# Face-Recognition
Its real time Face Recognition program.

Hello All,
This is a Face Recognition program.
In this i'm using cv2, os, numpy module.

In first part of program we take 100 sample pictures of user,
and then in second part we train our model and and testing it.

There is 3 parts in the recognition system:

In first, if user is verified and the user is same as the user in our sample then the message 'Unlocked' will print.

In second, if user is verified and the user is not same as the user in our sample then the message 'Locked' will print.

In third, if user is not verified then the the message 'User Not Found' will print.
